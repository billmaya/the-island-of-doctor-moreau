Book - Character Display Information

[
Order of characters in table determines how they appear in the character-row window, left to right, if they are in same room.

But I might want to use the position column to handle this explicitly.

For example, if Montgomery's position was 2, Moreau's position was 1, and Dogman's position was 3, if Moreau and Montgomery appeared in the same room Moreau would be displayed first, then Montgomery. If all three characters were in the same room, the display order would be Moreau, Montgomery, and Dogman.
